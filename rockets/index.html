            	I have been on QRET since 2018. After working on a succesful rocket in first year I became the aerodynamics lead, and designed the rocket seen at left, Now For Plan A, which flew to 25,500 ft at Mach 1.5+. I am now the CTO of the team and am working on a new rocket that will fly to above 30,000 ft and close to Mach 2. Additionally, if budget and time allow, a second rocket I have designed may be constructed - this one an attempt to beat the world "M" motor class altitude record of 45,500 ft, which would require speeds of nearly Mach 3.

            <div class="description">
            	While on internship in Vancouver, I joined the UBC rocket team. I worked on the airframe and internal structures of the "Whistler" rocket which is a liquid bipropellant rocket intended to reach space. Despite not being a UBC student, I was made subteam lead for a four-month period before my departure. I worked on thermal protection, intertank structures, fin optimisation, composites, and the prototyping of a sheet metal flush riveted nosecone. This rocket is BIG - the nosecone is almost my height.

				This project is a multi disciplinary one and one of my first ventures into custom on-board electronics as well as active rocket control. The goal is to actively stabilize the rocket by using the position of the sun in the sky using photoresistors.
