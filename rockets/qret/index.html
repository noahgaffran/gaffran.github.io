            	This rocket flew in 2019 after my first year. It reached 23,500 ft and placed 6th in class at Spaceport America. I worked on the nosecone and fins, as well as the flight simulations and apogee prediction.

            	This rocket was born on my laptop. I designed the overall concept layout, as well as the aerodynamic components. It flew in 2021 at Spaceport America, reaching 25,500 ft and Mach 1.5. During construction I was responsible for the couplers, fins, nosecone, as well as the finishing and painting of the rocket.

            	This upcoming academic year will see QRET's first rocket that will fly higher than 30,000 ft and it will be flown at Spaceport America and Launch Canada. It is based on the prior two rockets but with several reliablitiy and performance improvements. The team is also working on several side projects including a hybrid rocket motor, an automatic ground tracking antenna/camera system, custom on board electronics, and more, all of which I have been involved in facilitating.

            <div class="description">
            	This is a second rocket being built by just some of the QRET leadership team, with the goal of breaking the M-class motor record. It will be flown at Launch Canada on a CTI M2445 motor. This minimum-diameter rocket is completely optimized for performance, with every opportunity being taken to minimize weight while incorporating enough strength and thermal protection to survive a flight at nearly Mach 3 to over 40,000 ft.
