            	I am the CTO on the Queen's Rocket Engineering Team. We have competed at the international Spaceport America Cup as well as Launch Canada, flying supersonic rockets as high as 25,000 feet. I also have built smaller rockets personally, and in 2021-22 was a member of the UBC Rocket team, working on the airframe of a liquid bipropellant rocket intended to reach space.
