            	This rocket flew in 2019 after my first year. It reached 23,500 ft and placed 6th in class at Spaceport America. I worked on the nosecone and fins, as well as the flight simulations and apogee prediction.

            	This rocket was born on my laptop. I designed the overall concept layout, as well as the aerodynamic components. It flew in 2021 at Spaceport America, reaching 25,500 ft and Mach 1.5. During construction I was responsible for the couplers, fins, nosecone, as well as the finishing and painting of the rocket.

            	This upcoming academic year will see QRET's first rocket that will fly higher than 30,000 ft and it will be flown at Spaceport America and Launch Canada. A second rocket may also be built. The exact goal and performance is not yet public but I can say it will be very very fast.
