            	The goal of this project is to achieve my level 1 (and 2) high power rocketry certification from the Canadian Association of Rocketry. The rocket is scratch built. It is a 3" airframe with a 29mm motor mount. It was flown on a CTI H120 Blue Streak motor to about 1,250 ft and I successfully got the certification on 15 October 2022 at the Quebec Rocketry Club. The photo here is a second flight on a G54 Red Lightning motor to about 1,300 ft.

				The construction of an L1 certification rocket is generally simple, but I will lay out the process here. Most people prefer to build a rocket from a kit, but I decided to build a design of my own from parts, due to limited kit availability in Canada as well as the simple urge to create the design I really wanted, something that I could fly on a G motor in a public part, but also something that can take me through my CAR L1 and L2 certifications. I also wanted to have a fin geometry that minimized the chance of damage on landing, with a forward swept trailing edge, something that many kits similar to my rocket do not feature. The above image shows most of the parts I used to build the rocket, apart from the nose cone and the plywood for the fins.

            <div class="description">
				The first thing I did after using the software OpenRocket to design the rocket was cut the fin slots in the body tube. I made a paper template and transferred the slots to the body tube with a knife. The fins themselves were cut from a sheet of birch plywood using a printed paper template, an angle grinder, and a dremel with a cutting wheel.

				The next step was to build the motor mount tube. The centering rings were affixed to the phenolic tube with 5-minute epoxy, leaving just enough space in between them for the fin tabs. An eyebolt was attached and epoxied on to the upper centering ring to attach the kevlar shock cord which the parachute attaches to. Not pictured is the rear motor retainer which is attached at the bottom of the motor mount tube using JB Weld. The whole motor mount tube is then epoxied into the body tube, and the fins are tacked on with 5-minute epoxy, the tabs going all the way into contact with the motor mount tube. The fins may look complete at this point but there is still one important step remaining to increase their strength significantly.

				Before the fins were finished, the coupler tube was completed by epoxying in the bulkhead with a nice fillet. The eyebolt that the upper end of the recovery harness attaches to is also attached and epoxied in. This coupler was then epoxied in to the upper body tube.

				At this point the rocket looks essentially complete, but there are still some important steps that remain.

			<div class="description">
				To increase the strength of the fins and to prevent aerodynamic flutter, fillets are used. Instead of regular 5-minute epoxy, a thickened laminating epoxy was used. QRET's FiberGlast 2000 system was thickened with thixotropic silica. This creates a resin that is extremely thick and strong upon curing. The fillets are first masked off, then the thickened epoxy is applied liberally. A round tube is used to round off the fillet itself, before being unmasked and finally sanded smooth to remove any imperfections, especially at the leading and trailing edges.

			<div class="description">
				After the fillets are done, all that remains is to paint the rocket! I went for a bright yellow and green scheme that will make it easier to find if it drifts a longer distance on the parachute. To fly the rocket, all that is necessary is to insert the motor, attach the parachute and recovery harness, necessary fire protective gear, put the rocket on the rail, and fly!
